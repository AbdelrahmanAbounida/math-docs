# Logic

Mathematical logic is the study of formal reasoning. It provides the rules and structure that underpin all of mathematics and computer science.

## Key Topics

- **Propositional Logic** — statements, connectives (AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES), truth tables
- **Predicate Logic** — quantifiers (∀, ∃), predicates, and domains
- **Logical Equivalences** — De Morgan's laws, contrapositive, distributivity
- **Proof Strategies** — direct proof, contradiction, contrapositive, cases
- **Set Theory Basics** — sets, subsets, unions, intersections, complements
- **Boolean Algebra** — algebraic structure of logical operations
- **Model Theory** — interpretations and satisfaction of formulas
- **Computability & Decidability** — Gödel's incompleteness theorems, halting problem
