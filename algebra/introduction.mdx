# Algebra

Algebra studies mathematical structures such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. It generalizes arithmetic and provides the language for modern mathematics.

## Key Topics

- **Linear Algebra** — vectors, matrices, linear transformations, eigenvalues
- **Group Theory** — groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, symmetry
- **Ring Theory** — rings, ideals, polynomial rings
- **Field Theory** — fields, extensions, Galois theory
- **Vector Spaces** — bases, dimension, inner product spaces
- **Matrix Decompositions** — LU, QR, SVD, eigendecomposition
- **Systems of Equations** — Gaussian elimination, rank, nullity
- **Abstract Algebra Applications** — coding theory, cryptography
