# Proof

Mathematical proof is a rigorous argument that establishes the truth of a statement beyond any doubt. Learning to read and write proofs is central to all advanced mathematics.

## Key Topics

- **Direct Proof** — assuming premises and deriving the conclusion step by step
- **Proof by Contradiction** — assuming the negation and reaching a contradiction
- **Proof by Contrapositive** — proving the contrapositive of an implication
- **Mathematical Induction** — base case + inductive step for statements over natural numbers
- **Strong Induction** — using all preceding cases in the inductive step
- **Proof by Cases** — exhaustively covering all possibilities
- **Existence & Uniqueness Proofs** — constructive and non-constructive approaches
- **Diagonalization** — Cantor's technique for uncountability and beyond
