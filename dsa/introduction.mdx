# Data Structures & Algorithms

A structured approach to mastering DSA for interviews and real-world engineering.

## Topics to Cover

- **Arrays & Strings** — Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums
- **Linked Lists** — Reversal, fast/slow pointers, merge
- **Stacks & Queues** — Monotonic stack, BFS
- **Trees & Graphs** — DFS, BFS, shortest path, topological sort
- **Dynamic Programming** — Memoization, tabulation, common patterns
- **Sorting & Searching** — Binary search, merge sort, quick sort
- **Greedy & Backtracking** — Interval scheduling, permutations
