# Statistics

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It bridges probability theory with real-world data to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Key Topics

- **Descriptive Statistics** — mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation
- **Inferential Statistics** — drawing conclusions about populations from samples
- **Hypothesis Testing** — null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, significance levels
- **Confidence Intervals** — estimating population parameters with uncertainty bounds
- **Regression Analysis** — modeling relationships between variables
- **ANOVA** — comparing means across multiple groups
- **Bayesian Statistics** — incorporating prior knowledge into inference
- **Non-parametric Methods** — distribution-free statistical tests
