Random varibable is a key concept in statistics that connects theoretical probability with real-world data.
it is a function which converts our regular counting methods into generalized form so we can model the uncertinity

It maps uncertain events to numbers

### Why Random Variable ?

1. Cocise Summary of all Probabilities
2. PDF is a model of random process
3. Test Hypothesis with data
4. Visualize and compute data in a much easier way
5. Build functions on random variable
