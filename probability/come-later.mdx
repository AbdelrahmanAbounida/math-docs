3. How many different 4-letter "words" (arrangements) can be formed from the letters in "STATISTICS"?
4. A medical test is 95% accurate for detecting a disease (sensitivity) and 90% accurate for correctly identifying healthy people (specificity). If 1% of the population has the disease, what is the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease?
5. Counting with repetitions, Law of total probability, Geometric distribution
6. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
