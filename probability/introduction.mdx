# Probability

Probability is the branch of mathematics that studies the likelihood of events occurring. It provides the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty and reasoning about random phenomena.

## Key Topics

- **Sample Spaces & Events** — defining the set of all possible outcomes
- **Axioms of Probability** — Kolmogorov's foundational axioms
- **Conditional Probability** — P(A|B) and updating beliefs with new information
- **Bayes' Theorem** — reversing conditional probabilities
- **Random Variables** — discrete and continuous
- **Distributions** — Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Exponential, and more
- **Expectation & Variance** — summarizing distributions
- **Law of Large Numbers & Central Limit Theorem** — convergence results
