This is a theory put by Kolmogorov that define the probability mathematically
it puts three principles

1. There is no negative probability P(A) ≥ 0
2. Normalization For the whole sample space S: P(S)=1
3. If two events 𝐴 A and 𝐵 B cannot happen at the same time (disjoint events), then: P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)
