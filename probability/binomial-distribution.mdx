A binomial distribution describes the probability of getting a specific number of "successes" in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure) and the probability of success stays the same each time.

The formula:
The probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is:
P(X = k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)

What it looks like:
The distribution is often bell-shaped / normal distribution like (especially when n is large and p is near 0.5), but can be skewed if p is very small or very large.

Key parameters:

Mean (expected value) = n × p
Variance = n × p × (1-p)
