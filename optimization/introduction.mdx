# Optimization

Optimization is the mathematical discipline of finding the best solution from a set of feasible alternatives. It is central to machine learning, operations research, economics, and engineering.

## Key Topics

- **Unconstrained Optimization** — gradient descent, Newton's method, convexity
- **Constrained Optimization** — Lagrange multipliers, KKT conditions
- **Linear Programming** — simplex method, duality, sensitivity analysis
- **Convex Optimization** — convex sets, convex functions, disciplined convex programming
- **Integer Programming** — branch and bound, cutting planes
- **Dynamic Programming** — Bellman's principle of optimality
- **Stochastic Optimization** — stochastic gradient descent, Monte Carlo methods
- **Multi-objective Optimization** — Pareto optimality, trade-off analysis
